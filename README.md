# CSE381-Project
 
CSE381 - Advancded Game Programming

This was an original game created for this course using the Unity.

Game mechanics
-The player is made up of a bunch of cubes arranged in a 3x3x3 box which means the player has 3 unique faces.
-Each obstacle that is flying at the player has a opening that corresponds to one of the player's faces.
-The player has to rotate the shape such that the face on the z-axis (blue side) matches the opening.

The game starts out with the player (a cube) in an invisible box with portals on each face. Each portal teleports the player into a space 
tunnel. After being teleported, the player will change into a different shape and the player's movements will be restricted and the player
can only rotate themselves using Q (x-axis), W (y-axis), E (z-axis). As the player is traveling through the tunnel, there will be space 
meteoroids flying at the player and the player must rotate themselves to dodge the obstacles. THe player will transform into a different 
shape depending on which portal they take. The portal on the bottom is the only level that the player must past to win. In the last tunnel,
the player will be able to swap between all the other shapes using spacebar.
